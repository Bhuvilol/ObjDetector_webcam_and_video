# ObjDetector_webcam_and_video


This program is quite a bit slow because is running on CPU. It works completely smoothless if it directed to run via GPU. I currently dont have a GPU that why it is operating at 200+ms rate.
Try to run this program by directing this program to GPU by installing NVIDIA jetpack OS and its dependencies.
